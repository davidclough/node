MAINLY COPIED from main SampleCommands.txt as there is a bit too much in there and need to split into files that are in the more specific locations.

// From Aurelia talk.

jspm
jspm init

jspm install aurelia-framework
jspm install aurelia-bootstrapper

gulp bundle

npm yo
yo aurelia



NOTE: Accidentally created an "aurelia" folder (when I already had a "yo-tests\aurelia" one) and ran "yo aurelia".
      Main point is that wanted to UNINSTALL ALL the npm packages in a more automated way. Too many packages to want to uninstall individually.
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19106284/how-do-you-uninstall-all-dependencies-listed-in-package-json-npm indicated:
      Using powershell, can run the command "npm uninstall (Get-ChildItem).Name" when in "node_modules". This seemed to work pretty well.
NOTE: In same link, someone suggested the simpler looking "npm uninstall *". Will try that next time.




gulp watch
need to wait a while???
