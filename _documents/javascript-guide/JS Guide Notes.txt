This may come in handy if want to explain promises and deferreds in jQuery.

        console.clear();

        var doSomethingLater = function (fn, time) {
          var dfd = $.Deferred();

          setTimeout(function () {
            dfd.resolve(fn());
          }, time || 0);

          return dfd.promise();
        }

        var makePromise = function (functionNumber) {
          return doSomethingLater(function() {
            console.log("Function " + functionNumber + " executed after " + functionNumber + " seconds");
          }, functionNumber * 1000);
        };

        var promises = [];
        for (var i = 1; i <= 7; i++) {
          promises[i] = makePromise(i);
        }

        $.when(promises[1], promises[3], promises[4], promises[5], promises[2], promises[6], promises[7]).done(function (promise1, promise2) {
          // Handle both XHR objects
          console.log("All functions completed");
        });


        // This one definitely triggers the done() after EITHER completes.
        /*
        promise1.then(promise2).done(function(promise1, promise2) {
          // Handle both XHR objects
          console.log("One function completed");
        });

http://www.w3schools.com/js                 Avoid going into too much depth

JavaScript Language ECMAScript 5 (ES5)
    Emphasis on ES5 which works in IE8.
        Will leave out samples of most keywords as they behave in the same way as for other C-based language. Will include examples for ones that have some different behaviour
        Not about the use of the word PROPERTY
        Avoid trying to think in terms of C# and expecting things to behave the same and, if it doesn't it's rubbish. Good, bad, awful but if use the good stuff and structure well then it can be tamed to a large extent...
        Avoid belief that JS standards should be the same as C# standards
        In interests of this document not becoming bloated ... explanations may be quite short and will be intended to cover essentials, not every detail..., external links...
        JS offers a trade off - extra brittleness for lots of flexibility
        ??Many people: He expresses how he was once a complete advocate of "total strong typing" but has now been converted
        Cannot be complete reference - serves no purpose - if want to learn, need to read, watch videos and write test applications.
    sequential
        hoisting: all variable declarations are hoisted to top of scope. Same with functions, however, although function expressions are hoisted, the actual function assignment itself is not
        Bad to rely on hoisting though so using function 
    Types
        2: 5 types   as we all know by now JS uses dynamic typing so any type of value can be assign to any variable and type can be changed...
            Each of these are actually objects whose earliest ancestor in the prototype chain the the Object prototype
            String
            Number
                NaN     D7
                parseInt
            Boolean
            Array
            Object
                prototype
            null
            undefined
    Objects
        1: declaration
        myCar["make"]                   D16
        http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_properties.asp
        Prototype
        toString() and other members in the Object prototype
        Augmenting with additional methods
        Adjusting existing methods
    Arrays
        1: declaration
            adding properties after declaration
    Strings
    JS Keywords
    Functions
        Declarations and expressions (FtU D12) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1013385/what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-expression-vs-declaration-in-javascrip
        Use declaration syntax if define inside a loop (http://helephant.com/2012/07/14/javascript-function-declaration-vs-expression/)
        Space to avoid it looking like you have declared a function called "function".
        "arguments" property (it's not a true array but there is a trick to convert it to one)
        Keep small and single resp, e.g. split longer ones into separate functions.
        Try to keep non-UI logic in separate funtions from ones that manipulate the UI.

    Block scope
        no such thing - hoisting
        Scope is per containing function or object
    Global Namespace

The DOM
    Point them towards jQuery for DOM manipulation
    Windows
    Cookies
    Local Storage
    
Coding Style            DO put recommendations in the LANGUAGE section, rather than adding, separately, half a mile below.
    Whitespace
        Do not add spaces inside parentheses.
        Do not add spaces inside brackets.
        Add spaces inside curly braces.
    Destructuring (airbnb)
    Functions
        Try to keep small with single reponsibility 
    Blocks
        braces in blocks
    Comments
        Reduce by good var and func naming...
    <script>
        DOM D6: Don't bother with type="text/javascript". It is the wrong MIME TYPE (application/...) so no browsers cater for it.
        Genrally should AVOID putting JS within a page (keep in separate JS file). Sometimes you may want to take advantage of certain ASP.NET feature,
            one ob being binding to some part of a model via razor tags or web forms data binding tags. In that case keep the code to a minimum, e.g. assign the values of the tags to javacript module properties. Code within JS files can then reference those properties from then on. 
            Obviously you will have to structure your code so that the JS file(s) containing those variables have been included BEFORE the <script> code initialises them and 
    Location of <script> tags.
        Low in body (unlike CSS which are high in head)           This won't necessary always remain the case... async
    semicolon insertion
    Avoid excessively long lines. When a statement will not fit nicely on a single line, it may be necessary to break it. It is best to break after a { left brace, [ left bracket, ( left paren, , comma, or before a . period, ? question mark, or : colon. If such a break is not feasible, then break after an operator and continue on the next line with 8 spaces added to the current indentation. Those 8 spaces do not change the current indentation.
    Inline assignments and ++
    IIFEs: Why? An immediately invoked function expression is a single unit - wrapping both it, and its invocation parens, in parens, cleanly expresses this.
    Callback function parameters
    === and !==
        Either use if (a === null) or if (!a)
    Initialising Variable - Object Literals and Arrays, Bools
    Redefining and adding properties to standard types.
    Separation of business and UI
    Declarations
        Some say put all at top of container. Not really necessary as declaring just before use gives a better indication of intent. As long as people appreciate the concept of hoisting.
    Naming
        Descriptive but need to avoid clutter.
        Namespaces, e.g. PEP.         proactEnterprisePortal could seem to be a much more snsible choice to C# programmers but imagine the readability of code riddle with function calls like     proactEnterprisePortal.incidentManagementUtilities.createIncident()      PEP.incidents.create()
    Do not create functions within a loop (FtU D84)

Code Organisation
    File with the namespace object declaration which all modules and object constructors will be members of (it needs to be the FIRST out of the files with YOUR code)
        XXX You may find a requirement for some global variables may be need to work.  Put these within a module.
        Common functions that are used in all areas. Can define these within one or more modules.
        also module for vaues you may want to set via binding tags in web forms pages or razor views.
    Custom jQuery plugins - include after jQuery...
    File per module or object
    You may want some files KendoHelper... NO
    Bundling

    that (or self) keyword
    Object.create()
    prototype
    Inheritance
        Just generally suggest ideas that COULD be implemented (different patterns, shared secrets, supermethods, keep hierarchies shallow) - patterns av in JS are diff from C#...
        Also indicate that these may be described in separate file.
        Also indicate that probably don't really need this for the size of our code bases and, if we ever do write larger code bases, consider using TypeScript.
        Prototypical inheritance
    console.log();
    debugger;
    console.trace();
    eval() - avoid. State the one case where have used.

Standards: Requirements + Recommendations


script type not necessary but no harm - NO POINT mentioning in standards
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Placing_the_Code:
    While the text/javascript was formally obsoleted in April 2006 by RFC 4329

Location:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-is-the-best-place-to-put-script-tags-in-html-markup
    Mentions bottom as antiquated but ASYNC and DEFER are not reliable enough across all browsers
https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom=
    Would imagine this is up to date. NOT TOTALLY
    "If a script can be deferred, it can also be moved to the bottom of the page. That will make your web pages load faster."
Necessary stuff, e.g. maybe namespace, can be put in a small bundle and included at the top.
NOT SURE if worth mentioning this.

Namespaces - always have one. Caps and small recommended as will avoid clutter and immediately know it is a namespace.
    A long descriptive namespace will quickly become annoying and use of camel case leaves people guessing if it the namespace object or a normal object.
    There is no acknowledged standard but I like.

// Comments - be generous - if code inside a method is greater than handful of lines there is a good chance that code is NOT self documenting, even if person writing at the time thinks it is.
