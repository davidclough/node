## Discussed Headings;


	* Namespaces
	* Private/Public
	* Functions
	* Constants
	* Objects
	* Be careful with Context - self/this which to use and when
	* Documentation and how to use JSdocs - setup etc, commenting of code
	* Using strings populated from resource
	*  Operators e.g. == === etc... look at truthy falsey
	* loops https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration 
	* Jquery e.g. selectors
	* Regex - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions 

	* Unit Testing: QUnit or Jasmine         Can't really do at the moment

	* Inheritance

## Standards
As well as defining our standards it might be good to "piggy back" on top of a more global set of standards. Problem is that, unlike something like C#, there are many varied ideas. One such site is https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml which seems not to go over the top and looks quite general without seeming to be an expression of one person's opinion.

# Overview #
I have added this page to act as a note for what we want to cover and achieve.

## Goals ##
- Create a comprehensive set of guidelines
- Cover JSDocs to document JavaScript functions and promote reuse on team projects
- Cover setting up and utilising a JavaScript frameworks such as JSHint
- Create a JavaScript sample to be included in future projects to show an example of namespaces, JSDocs and other guidelines we list

## Guideline Topics ##
- Namespaces
- Public methods and properties
- Private methods and properties
- Other rules from [https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml ](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)
***- More to be added....***
