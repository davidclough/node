# vuex-basics

> A Vue.js project

## DC Notes

Downloaded from his source code and modified whilst watching his [STATE & STORE | VueJS 2 & Vuex | Learning the Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSr2vBApSI) videos, starting with:

- [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSr2vBApSI) - Here he sets up the store and stores users and registered users within it. The only problem is he directly manipulates all the data from within the `App.vue` file and also in a rather manual way.
- [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw1eajzWQAM)
- [Video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkFWOsKrPAI)   ??????

The first thing he added was the `store.js` file.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
