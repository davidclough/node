# vuex-basics

> A Vue.js project

## DC Notes

This was his original source code, downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/vuejs2-vuex-basics).

There is no Vuex store. He instead emits events from within components and handles them within the `App.vue`, which contains those components.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
