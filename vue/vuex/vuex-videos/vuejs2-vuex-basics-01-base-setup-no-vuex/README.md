# vuex-basics

> A Vue.js project

## DC Notes

Downloaded from his source code and modified whilst watching his videos, starting with [STATE & STORE | VueJS 2 & Vuex | Learning the Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSr2vBApSI).


The first thing he added was the `store.js` file.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
