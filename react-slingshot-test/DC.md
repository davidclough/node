warning "react-router-redux@5.0.0-alpha.6" has incorrect peer dependency "react@^15".
[https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/5611](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/5611)
package.json references react 16. react-router-redux references react 15 in its package.json.

This seems like a good site for examining verions of libraries and versions of their dependencies:
